# coin-detection-using-image-processing  
Coin Detection Algorithm using pure computational Image Processing Techniques (Hough Transform) in MATLAB  
This code counts the number of coins in the image and gives the center and radius of each coin present in the image.  
It does this job without using any AI ML models.
